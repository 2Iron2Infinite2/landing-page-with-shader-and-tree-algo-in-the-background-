I wanted a simple landing page that feels alive — a soft gradient vibe, a glassy/iridescent panel, and little trees that grow when you click. Nothing heavy, just a tiny web component that’s fun to play with.

What’s happening: a procedural “tree/graph” spawns on click (grows level by level, wobbles a bit), while a custom GLSL panel shader animates behind the UI.
Tech: Three.js (ES modules via CDN) + plain JS/DOM + custom fragment shader.
I enjoy making small, interactive front-ends with shaders — this is one of those.
